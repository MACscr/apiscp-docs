title: "3.0"
---

apnscp v3.0, sponsored by project creep, has been released. This is the first public major release after [16 years](http://old.apisnetworks.com/apnscpyears.php) of development. All major milestones have been implemented, including experimental preview of [rspamd](https://hq.apnscp.com/filtering-spam-with-rspamd/), a vastly superior spam filtering engine, that will power DKIM/ARC signing as well as rate-limiting outbound mail in future releases of apnscp.

A new migration play has been shipped with this announcement that automatically changes the apnscp update policy from `edge` to `major`, which will check for and deploy updates up to the major version. 3.0.0 -> 3.0.1 and 3.0.1 -> 3.1.0 will process automatically. 3.1.0 to 4.0.0 will be blocked. Set `apnscp_update_policy` to `edge` to continue to receive the latest nightly code. apnscp.update-policy is a shortcut command to this [Bootstrapper setting](https://github.com/apisnetworks/apnscp-playbooks/blob/47f68ab42de210368a8d9664dc7ae611e13419e7/apnscp-vars.yml#L44:L50). If you're a few updates behind, do this after updating the panel.

```bash
upcp -b
cpcmd config_set apnscp.update-policy edge
```

New trial licenses will be valid for 60 days during a 15-day transitional grace period, after which time new licenses will be issued with a 30 day trial. All expiring licenses must be converted to a paid license within [my.apnscp.com](https://my.apnscp.com/)'s user portal (**Settings** > **Licenses**). A conversion facility will be up no later than February 15. You may reach out to me directly at [matt@apisnetworks.com](mailto:matt@apisnetworks.com) for license conversions until then.

apnscp lifetime licenses are on sale for $129 to celebrate this release. The regular retail price afterwards will be $249 for a lifetime or $10/month for pay-as-you-go. Head on over to the client area of [my.apnscp.com](https://my.apnscp.com/) to get started.

ðŸ‘‰ As with all former releases, refer to the v3.0 [pre-alpha technical release announcement](https://hq.apnscp.com/apnscp-pre-alpha-technical-release/) for installation and usage. ðŸ‘ˆ

For existing installations, apnscp will update automatically overnight as long as `apnscp_nightly_update` is enabled (default: yes). If you disabled automatic updates or are many versions behind, update apnscp manually with:

```bash
upcp -b
```

## Important changes

- [rspamd](https://hq.apnscp.com/filtering-spam-with-rspamd/) + [SRS](http://www.openspf.org/SRS) support. SRS reforms a forwarded email's envelope to match the forwarding server. Fixes DKIM/SPF problems with forwarded messages
- Virus scan support in **Web** > **Web Apps** when `clamav_enabled` [is set](https://github.com/apisnetworks/apnscp-playbooks#low-memory-mode)
- `upcp` supports running components, e.g. `upcp -b mail/rspamd`
- mod_evasive configuration scope, `cpcmd config_get apache.evasive`
- Auto-learn feature by dragging mail in/out of Spam folder
- Argos supports several new [backends](https://hq.apnscp.com/monitoring-with-monit-argos/), including Slack
- Bootstrapper override support (/root/apnscp-vars-runtime.yml), `cpcmd config_get apnscp.bootstrapper`
- Sticky workers - apnscpd will reuse a hot session if possible to eliminate reinitialization overhead

Even though the beta was determined to be the final incremental release before 3.0 final, this release includes over 450 changes to polish delivery, some of which bear further mention.

### rspamd

[rspamd](https://hq.apnscp.com/filtering-spam-with-rspamd/) is the biggest change over beta. SpamAssassin was the preferred method of filtering that with sufficient samples and a global Bayes database works reasonably well, but filtering is slow, integration limited, and its algorithm [brain dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier). rspamd uses Markov modeling to adaptively filter spam in an asynchronous event loop. rspamd is gentler on memory, faster (20-30x faster), and best part yet: a [milter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milter). Milters are mail filters that speak directly with the MTA, Postfix in this case, to act as a gatekeeper for mail both inbound *and* outbound. rspamd can accept, reject, temporarily reject, and alter mail headers at connection time instead of once a message has been taken in for processing thereby rationing precious CPU cycles.

rspamd is the future of apnscp. It's released now for early testing to begin a long road of integration that will ultimately provide inbound spam filtering in addition to outbound rate-limiting, filtering, and DKIM/ARC signing to ensure mail that leaves an apnscp server is the most reputable possible.

Check out the filtering post below for a detailed explanation of usage.

- [Filtering with rspamd](https://hq.apnscp.com/filtering-spam-with-rspamd/) (hq.apnscp.com)
- [rspamd Bootstrapper vars](https://github.com/apisnetworks/apnscp-playbooks/blob/master/roles/mail/rspamd/defaults/main.yml) (github.com)

### Bootstrapper cpcmd support

`cpcmd` supports Bootstrapper overrides. Overrides are written to `/root/apnscp-vars-runtime.yml` and can be used to replace any default variable in any component of [Bootstrapper](https://github.com/apisnetworks/apnscp-playbooks). apnscp automatically infers and converts types.

For example, to enable low memory mode and update all services accordingly:

```bash
cpcmd config_set apnscp.bootstrapper has_low_memory true
upcp -b
```

To set autolearn thresholds for rspamd, use an array:

```bash
cpcmd config_set apnscp.bootstrapper rspamd_autolearn_threshold '[-2.0,15]'
upcp -sb mail/rspamd
```

Use `cpcmd config_get apnscp.bootstrapper` to list all overrides. `-b` runs Bootstrapper playbooks. `-s` bypasses code update prior to running playbooks. `mail/rspamd` or anything else afterwards restricts Bootstrapper to those named roles in [bootstrap.yml](https://github.com/apisnetworks/apnscp-playbooks/blob/master/bootstrap.yml).

### Mailbox guided learning

apnscp now ships with [sieve support](https://wiki.dovecot.org/Pigeonhole/Sieve) for IMAP mailboxes. Drag and drop mail into and out of the "Spam" folder to train messages as spam/ham respectively. By default mail that's sent to the Spam folder is automatically learned as spam, but this behavior can be quickly changed to monitor the Trash folder instead:

```bash
cpcmd config_set apnscp.bootstrapper dovecot_learn_spam_folder "{{ dovecot_imap_root }}Trash"
upcp -sb mail/configure-dovecot
```

All mail deleted from an IMAP client will be learned as spam. Refer back to `/var/log/maillog` for confirmation,

```
Jan 21 15:54:44 jib dovecot: imap(msaladna@apisnetworks.com): sieve: pipe action: piped message to program 'learn-spam.sh'
```

### Virus scans

![img](https://hq.apiscp.com/content/images/2019/01/virus-scan-feature.png)

apnscp will inspect a web app for suspicious files when ClamAV is enabled. It's disabled by default if `has_low_memory` is enabled. This can be overrode with `clamav_enabled`,

```bash
cpcmd config_set apnscp.bootstrapper clamav_enabled
upcp -b
```

An anti-virus is only as effective as its heuristics dictate, which is at the mercy of humans who recognize patterns and write heuristics to cover. That is to say an AV can only detect what it knows to detect and nothing more. It won't catch all viruses, but should provide guidance when importing a new client's Wordpress site from say Hostgator that has an [incentive](https://websitesforgood.com/beware-of-malware-scams-sitelock-hostgator-and-an-angry-web-girl/) to keep servers insecure.

`file_scan` is the corresponding low-level API command.

```bash
cpcmd -d someaccount.com file_scan /var/www/html
```

## In the pipeline

Now that 3.0 has been released, it's time to address [feature requests](https://github.com/apisnetworks/apnscp/issues) that will be implemented in 3.1. This includes support for ownCloud, TimescaleDB metrics, PHP-FPM (when `apache,jail=1` is configured for a site), Dovecot/Postfix SNI via haproxy, and block storage attachment. These will be incrementally rolled out as part of the master branch, so if you'd like to continue to receive technology as it's released, set your update policy to "edge":

```bash
cpcmd config_set apnscp.update-policy edge
```

As always if you run into any issues stop by the [forums](https://forums.apnscp.com/) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/wDBTz6V). I'll be there!
