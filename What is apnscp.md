# What is apnscp?

apnscp is a control panel + platform produced by Apis Networks since 2003 that provides high performance, integrated security, and multi-tenant isolation. 

# What are some features of apnscp?

* apnscp is built on PHP7, which means it's fast, very fast. Further, apnscp integrates a few Laravel fixins, including [Blade templates](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/blade) and several [helpers](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/helpers) that users familiar with Laravel or even PHP, will value in its ease of extendibility.


* apnscp bundles its isolation and resource enforcement component, as that is part of its platform, into the license. 
* apnscp provides any-version Node, Python, and Ruby that are isolated to an account. This allows multiple users to run multiple versions without interfering with others.

# Is apnscp stable?

apnscp has been continuously in development and actively in use with our clients, encompassing beyond 15,000, since 2003. Our hosting subsidiary serves as a test bed for early features with consistent monitoring to ensure releases, once tagged and bundled for release, are stable too. 

Having an active hosting business also affords a 360Â° view of active threats and emerging patterns that can in turn be incorporated into the panel. For example, [mod_evasive](https://github.com/apisnetworks/mod_evasive) and its subsequent patches were integrated into the platform as a response to curtail brute-force attempts witnessed on production servers.

apnscp is designed first to run on our production servers. It is covered by unit tests and unit tests cover predictable inputs.
